GitHub repository PlasmaModz for kindle fire(work in progress)

PlasmaModz is an app made for my custom ROM for kindle fire 1st gen. It allowed users to make their own cutsom theme using provided assets. It was the first app I ever made, and the first project I ever worked on. The coding is really crappy.
